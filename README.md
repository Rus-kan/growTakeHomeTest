# growTakeHomeTest
Hi Grow hiring team,

Thank you for great assignment, I've been able to learn little bit more about your product.

Make sure:
  1) Java 1.8 installed 
  2) Maven installed
  
After downloading this code open terminal and run:
    => cd <path/growTakeHomeTest>
    => mvn clean install (it's actually going to run all tests within the package)
    => mvn clean test -Dtest=testCases.TestDashboard (another command to execute tests)
 
Check /extendReport folder for reports and /logs folder for logs(now very rich log file, just opening and closing test)
To see what tools I used to finish current tests open pom.xml file and in dependecies section you will see all tools.

P.S. just in case your machine not able to recognize 'mvn' command check your "environment variables" and provide path to maven under MAVEN_HOME, maven/bin to 'path'.

Thank you again!
